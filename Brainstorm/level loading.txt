The core game loop functions as a "Storm-Breaking" progression: the player begins in a room shrouded in a dark, stormy night where Deep Water boundaries cause lethal damage to low-level hulls, forcing them to navigate a narrow "safe" channel to find and defeat a local boss ship. Once the enemy is sunk, a "Time-Lapse" transition triggers—the screen fades as the sun rises, the dark water turns calm and traversable, and the player sails to the next room's threshold. Upon entering the new area, a "Sailing" animation plays to simulate travel, the sky quickly fades back into a dangerous storm, and the cycle repeats with higher level requirements and tougher enemies guarding the next Point B.
